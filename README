Description
-----------
This plugin allows to turn off delivery systems for a device.
It may be used to disable
- one or more delivery systems for multi-delivery-system devices.
- tuners not connected to a cable
- the tuner of an old full-featured card.

For now the configuration is static and must be compiled-in.
See 'TODO: configuration' in delsys.c.

Examples:
(1) DVB-C/DVB-T combo device: Allow DVB-T, disable DVB-C
    dvb_c_action[0] = action_deny; // device 0: no DVB-C

(2) DVB-C/DVB-T combo device: Allow DVB-C, disable DVB-T
    dvb_t_action[1] = action_deny; // device 1: no DVB-T

(3) Disable the tuner of an old full-featured DVB-S card
    dvb_s_action[0] = action_deny; // device 0: no DVB-S


Have fun,

Oliver
